> Financial Statement Investing Tool

## Background
The goal of this tool is to easily assess which stocks are currently best for value-investing (long-term
holding).  Inspiration comes largely from financial math classes taken at PSU and reading a large number of
books on financial analytics, especially by/on Warren Buffet who is most notable for his value-Investing
analytics and the idea of a "durable competitive advantage".  All of the thresholds for seeing if
ratios/growth/etc are acceptable are taken right from Warren or other notable investors.

In more detail, the goal of this tool is to take potentially every financial statement of every company listed
on an exchange, analyze them, then compare them across the same industry and overall, and come to a
conclusion as to which stocks to potentially long/short.

This tool will be able to take a single financial statement (quarterly/annually/etc), parse it into a standard
format, read in values, calculate ratios and other factors, then output an analysis and an overall "score" of
the company.  This tool will also be able to take multiple financial statements from the same company across
a period of time and give a more detailed analysis of growth and such.  This tool will also be able to take
multiple companies within an industry and compare them across a period of time and give a more detailed
analysis.  This tool will also be able to take multiple industry analyses and compare them overall to give an
even more detailed analysis, and find the overall greatest and not-so-greatest picks at this current time.
