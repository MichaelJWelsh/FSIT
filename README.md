> Financial Statement Investing Tool

## Background
The goal of this tool is to easily assess which stocks are currently best for value-investing (long-term
holding).  Inspiration comes largely from financial math classes taken at PSU and reading a large number of
books on financial analytics, especially by/on Warren Buffet who is most notable for his value-Investing
analytics and the idea of a "durable competitive advantage".  All of the thresholds for seeing if
ratios/growth/etc are acceptable are taken right from Warren or other notable investors.

In detail, the goal of this tool is to take potentially every financial statement of every company listed on
an exchange, analyze them, then compare them across the same industry and overall, and come to a
conclusion as to which stocks to potentially buy.
